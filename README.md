# hello-world
In this repo, I am exploring how to use GitHub. Hello, world!

I am a student at UC Berkeley interested in statistics, math, and computer science.
I am hoping to gain familiarity with GitHub so that I can participate in various projects
during my time at Berkeley. I enjoy running, spending time with friends, and most
forms of media entertainment.
